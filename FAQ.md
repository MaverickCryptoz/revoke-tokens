# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This FAQ provides answers to common questions about managing token permissions on blockchain explorers and the implications of those actions. It's meant to enhance your understanding and guide you through maintaining security and control over your digital assets.

## Why do I need to revoke token permissions?

Revoking token permissions is a critical step in managing the security of your digital assets. When you interact with decentralized applications (dApps) or smart contracts, you often grant them permission to access or use your tokens. However, once your interaction is complete or if you decide not to use that dApp anymore, those permissions remain unless actively revoked. Revoking permissions limits potential security risks, such as unauthorized access or token transfers, particularly if a dApp becomes compromised or acts maliciously.

## What are the risks of not revoking permissions?

Failing to revoke permissions can leave your tokens vulnerable to unauthorized actions by smart contracts or dApps you previously interacted with. In the event that one of these entities is compromised or turns out to be malicious, it could potentially lead to the loss of your tokens without your direct intervention. Keeping permissions only for applications you actively use and trust is a good practice to minimize these risks.

## How often should I check my token permissions?

It's advisable to review and manage your token permissions regularly. A good rule of thumb is to check your permissions:
- After you stop using a dApp.
- Periodically, such as every few months, to review and revoke any unused permissions.
- Immediately, if you hear news of vulnerabilities or issues with a dApp you have used in the past.

Regular checks ensure that only current and trusted applications have access to your tokens.

## Can revoking permissions affect my ability to use certain decentralized applications (dApps)?

Yes, revoking permissions can affect your ability to interact with certain dApps. For example, if you revoke permission for a token swap platform, you'll need to re-authorize the dApp the next time you wish to use it. This is a minor inconvenience compared to the potential security benefits of revoking unnecessary permissions. Always ensure that you trust and actively use a dApp before granting it permissions again.

Remember, maintaining control over who can access your tokens is an essential part of managing your digital assets securely.
